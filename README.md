Gradient and its successor Wirra-Way

all of my "working" shit skid mod menus for gta5.


Compiled release binary works in game version 1.61. Same version as uploaded on UC.


Every menu here is heavily skidded. Im not proud of or endourse any of the practices employed here. 

Everything in the LEGACY folder is essentially a show of my attempts at learning to code at 14. Wouldn't say im proud of any of it


Wirra-Way was my attempt at  learning to get back into gta modding as a result i used YimMenu as a "base". But turns out it was easier to call YimMenus functions from my ui then make my own. Making this was no longer fun and as a result im open sourcing all my shitty "work"


if you want a native UI from 2017 thats worse than stuff like bigbase in every way feel free to use i guess. 
All 1.61 UI files are contained within the "NAtivePortable" folder, add to your project call the main function from NATIVEbase.h from within your main loop. I wouldnt use this though. Its terrible Ui code that has been hacked up over 5 years.
